# Autonomous-Self-Learning-Robot
arduino robot using five sensors linefollower module  to move  through the maze. 

## How it works
When it meets crossroad it
- First stage
  1. Go left road first .
  2. If the left road is wrong it go back and try the right one.
  3. If the right road is wrong it go back and try the forward one,untill it reach the  end.
  4. It saves the data of the first stage and use it at the second one.
- Second stage
when it meets the crossroads it select the correct road (which it knowns from the first stage) so it reach the end directly without searching.
